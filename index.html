<h2>This site is under development...</h2>

<p>I made this website, hosted with github pages, to embed some of the stuff I frequently look up in a simple lightweight site that works on low powered devices, like my KaiOS phone or my Kindle K3. I have no experience making a website, and am using basic HTML, JS, and CSS.</p>

<!-- feel free to give me a job if you want, i use vim and arch btw ðŸ˜Ž-->

<a href="./weather.html"><button>Weather</button></a>
<a href="./twitch.html"><button>Twitch</button></a>
<a href="./k3reader.html"><button>Reddit reader (not working yet)</button></a>

<br>
<br>

To-do list:
<br>
-make the twitch search function change the video player without reloading the page, and change the current url parameters also without reloading the page
<br>
-make a function to search a twitch channel's recent VODs and create links for each one w/ url parameters?
