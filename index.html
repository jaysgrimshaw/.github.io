<h2>This site is under development...</h2>

<p>I made this website, hosted with github pages, to embed some of the stuff I frequently look up in a simple lightweight site that works on low powered devices, like my KaiOS phone or my Kindle K3. I have no experience making a website, and am using basic HTML, JS, and CSS.</p>

<!-- feel free to give me a job if you want, i use vim and arch btw ðŸ˜Ž-->
